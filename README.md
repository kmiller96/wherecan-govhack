# WhereCan? - A GovHack Project

Where can I best locate my new business? How much rent will I be paying? Will I have any competitors? WhereCan maps out the business climate of the past, now and future, so that you can find a great location.

All you need to give us is a suburb and a business type, in return we'll give you a score indicating how likely your business is to succeed based upon your demographic targets, likely expenses and existing competition.

We measure average tax, rent, wages and income by location and industry sector. We also look into foot traffic and nearby construction to measure how often customers are likely to come by.

All of this can be filtered by a target demographic differentiated by sex, age, cultural background, and marital status.
